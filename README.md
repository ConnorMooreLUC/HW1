# Homework-1-Digging-Into-Chicago-Data
Late start to Homework 1,  Project will be done in Python.

6/25:

Still working on Data extraction hopefully I will be fixing the 
dictionary issues today. After that I will be working on geospatial data, and finally analyis.

Overall the intention of my program was as follows:
User runs program and the console prompts the user to pick a neighborhood from a list of all Chicago neighborhoods.

Next a list of all libraries in that neighborhood would be displayed.  The console would then prompt the user to either display
analytics of the libraries or return to the main menu.

I was a little overwhelmed by the data set I picked.  However I made slow progress on completing a file reader. Next step would be to
implement the GIS and create the console functionality.
