# Homework-1-Digging-Into-Chicago-Data
Late start to Homework 1,  Project will be done in Python.

6/25:

Still working on Data extraction hopefully I will be fixing the 
dictionary issues today. After that I will be working on geospatial data, and finally analyis.

Overall the intention of my program was as follows:
User runs program and the console prompts the user to pick a neighborhood from a list of all Chicago neighborhoods.

Next a list of all libraries in that neighborhood would be displayed.  The console would then prompt the user to either display
analytics of the libraries or return to the main menu.

I was a little overwhelmed by the data set I picked.  However I made slow progress on completing a file reader. Next step would be to
implement the GIS and create the console functionality.

6/26-27:

GIS functionality is pretty much done. However it is slow as hell. ~2 mins.  Which I will tinker with. 

Much of the problems with the project so far have involved manipulating the GIS software into the format I wanted it.  Once I sorted that out. The dictionary parsing pretty much wrote itself. 

Next step would be to get to my console, and analytics.  And following that would be unit testing. 

6/27:  Made progress towards console ran into trouble with file reading. Then inadvertantly deleted my files. It is late, so I going to sleep.

Best.
